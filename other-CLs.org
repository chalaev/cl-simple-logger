The code was developped on [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]].

It is probably easy to make it work on [[https://www.cons.org/cmucl/][cmucl]] and [[https://clisp.sourceforge.io/][clisp]];
one just has to find (or write) replacements for the following [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]]-functions:
~sb-ext:make-timer~, ~sb-ext:schedule-timer~, and ~sb-ext:unschedule-timer~.

Later I might use the following recipe found online to overcome this difficulty:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; this is for for cmucl, for clisp should be similar
(defun make-timer (fun period)
  (mp:make-process #'(lambda ()
		       (loop
			  (funcall fun)
			  (sleep period))) :name "timer"))
#+END_SRC

GCL 2.6.12 (2016) seems to be incompatible with ~quicklisp~.

BTW, some years ago I've heard that ~GCL~ is abandoned â€“ pity, it was once probably the fastest 
of all freely-available common lisp dialects :(
