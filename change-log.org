Change log for [[https://github.com/chalaev/cl-simple-logger][cl-simple-logger]].

* Lazy development
Because of its simplicity this code does not have many bugs to be fixed or new ideas to be implemented.

** Packaged and compiled
I think that this code is virtually bug free and stable (no major changes expected) now.

added change-log.org + minor updates to [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] and [[file:README.org][README.org]]

*** 2020-11-27

*** 2020-11-21

*** 2020-11-14
added other-CLs.org + improved portability + updated asdf and defpackage declarations
